           <p>The symbol of the Centre for Disaster Management Studies comprises six parallel lines representing the Letter ‘C’ of Centre, while the intersection of the parallel lines signifies the formation of a network. The network illustrates diverse backgrounds, professions and disciplines coming together under one umbrella for the common goal of risk reduction and disaster management Thus, <b>CDMS</b> is interdisciplinary in all its forms  and attributes.</p>
  <p>The different hands clutching onto each other represent the
unity and strength that this Centre will provide to all its
stakeholders, similar to how a nation and its different agencies
become one for damage reduction during any hazard or
disaster.</p>
<p>
Harboured between secured hands is an illustration of people
amidst nature. It represents the interrelationship between the
two, as also what the people united as one can do for the
protection and promotion of nature and its very own people.</p>
<p>
All these aspects come together to shape the all-inclusive LOGO of the <b>Centre for Disaster Management Studies.</b></p>
